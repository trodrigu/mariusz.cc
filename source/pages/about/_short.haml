              Ashley Albright | User Experience Designer

              I have a Retailing and Consumer Science degree from
              the University of Arizona. I found User Experience Design
              just over four months ago and felt that it fit my personality.
              I love being able to discover ways to apply design thinking
              principles to solve people's biggest pain points as well as
              finding solutions. By designing apps to improve people's
              lives my design skills have become more defined.
